## Implementation Examples

### Customer Support Enhancement

Automatically analyze customer emails and route them to appropriate departments:

```python
# Analyze customer email
analysis = client.nlp.analyze(
    text=email_content,
    features=["sentiment", "topics", "intent"]
)

# Route based on analysis
if analysis.sentiment.label == "negative":
    priority = "high"
    department = "escalation_team"
elif "billing" in analysis.topics:
    department = "billing_support"
else:
    department = "general_support"

# Create support ticket
create_ticket(
    content=email_content,
    priority=priority,
    department=department,
    sentiment=analysis.sentiment.label
)
```

### Sales Forecasting

Predict next quarter's sales based on historical data:

```python
# Prepare historical data
historical_data = {
    "monthly_sales": [100000, 120000, 115000, 130000],
    "marketing_spend": 15000,
    "season": "Q4",
    "new_products": 2,
    "market_conditions": "favorable"
}

# Generate forecast
forecast = client.analytics.predict(
    model_id="sales_forecast_v3",
    features=historical_data,
    prediction_horizon=90  # 3 months
)

print(f"Predicted sales: ${forecast.prediction:,.2f}")
print(f"Confidence: {forecast.confidence:.1%}")
```

### Image-Based Quality Control

Automatically detect defects in manufacturing:

```python
import requests

# Capture image from production line
image_data = capture_production_image()

# Analyze for defects
result = client.vision.analyze(
    image=image_data,
    features=["defect_detection", "quality_score"]
)

if result.quality_score < 0.8:
    # Flag for manual inspection
    flag_for_inspection(
        defects=result.defects,
        confidence=result.quality_score,
        timestamp=datetime.now()
    )
    
    # Stop production line if critical
    if result.quality_score < 0.6:
        stop_production_line()
        alert_quality_team(result.defects)
```

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation

1. **Clean Your Data**: Remove irrelevant information
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Standardize data formats
3. **Representative Samples**: Ensure data represents real scenarios
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep training data current

### Model Selection

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models and iterate
2. **Domain-Specific**: Use industry-specific models when available
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy, precision, recall
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare different models in production

### Integration Strategy

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with low-risk processes
2. **Human in the Loop**: Maintain human oversight initially
3. **Fallback Plans**: Have backup processes ready
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance

### Security and Compliance

1. **Data Privacy**: Follow GDPR, CCPA regulations
2. **Access Controls**: Limit API key access
3. **Audit Trails**: Log all API calls
4. **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for all communications
